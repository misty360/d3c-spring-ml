# d3c-spring-ml project
Deportation Risk Detector for international students to determine if they may be at risk of deportation. We webscraped news articles to gather data about past deportation cases and pre-processed as well as analyzed it before creating our XGBoost machine learning model. We created the frontend of the project using Streamlit so that users can try our project in realtime.
